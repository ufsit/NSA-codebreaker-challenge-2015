Thanks to your outstanding work, our last mission was a success.

Unfotunately, although we now have the capability to decrypt messages with 
a valid key, our agents have recently intercepted a message where a valid 
key was not found.

It is believed that this message has more mission critical information. We
need you to figure out how to decrypt the provided message by reverse 
engineering the binary with an invalid key.

[Win this challenge by getting the original executable to print the message
hidden in tier2_msg.txt]
