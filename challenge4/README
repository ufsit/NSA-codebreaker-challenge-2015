It is now your final mission. We have learned from our agents that 
public keys may have already been distributed to our advisaries.

We need you to write an exploit that tricks the codebreaker3 binary into 
thinking that it has a valid message without a valid key.

Encode the following message into the template file from the last challenge. Make sure the decrypted message is valid with any key!

[Message: SENSITIVE MESSAGE: Leadership has arranged a meeting with the local authorities to discuss partnering opportunities. As a high-ranking member in our organization, your attendance is requested. Meet at the city police station at 18:00. Be discreet, and come unarmed as to not draw attention. Mention the pass code qb9rfop68mtmeq7uea5c at the front desk to be escorted in.]
